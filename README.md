# Big-Data
Projects done in Big Data at Booth School of Business

Course Description: 
Course is about data mining: the analysis, exploration, and simplification of large high-dimensional datasets. 
Students will learn how to model and interpret complicated `Big Data' and become adept at building powerful models for prediction and classification.

Techniques covered include an advanced overview of linear and logistic regression, model choice and false discovery rates, multinomial and binary regression, classification, decision trees, factor models, clustering, the bootstrap and cross-validation. We learn both basic underlying concepts and practical computational skills, including techniques for analysis of distributed data.

Heavy emphasis is placed on analysis of actual datasets, and on development of application specific methodology. Among other examples, we will consider consumer database mining, internet and social media tracking, network analysis, and text mining.

*Some projects were done individually and some were done in collaboration as noted on the top of the file
